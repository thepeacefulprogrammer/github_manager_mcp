# Task List for GitHub Project Manager MCP

## Current Status
✅ **All tests passing! Completed Task 2.0: Fix PRD Completion GraphQL Query Structure**

## Task 1.0: Task-PRD Relationship Querying System - **[x] COMPLETED**
- [x] 1.1 Implement basic relationship validation and hierarchy consistency checks
- [x] 1.2 Implement cascade completion logic for automatic parent completion
- [x] 1.3 Implement hierarchical status synchronization and progress tracking
- [x] 1.4 Implement enhanced relationship querying and filtering capabilities
- [x] 1.5 Implement dependency management and validation between levels

## Task 2.0: Fix PRD Completion GraphQL Query Structure - **[x] COMPLETED**
- [x] 2.1 Analyze GraphQL error in PRD completion functionality
- [x] 2.2 Research correct GitHub Projects v2 GraphQL schema
- [x] 2.3 Fix GraphQL query structures in handlers
- [x] 2.4 Fix field value processing in models and handlers
- [x] 2.5 Implement comprehensive tests for GraphQL fixes
- [x] 2.6 Test PRD completion with real GitHub API calls

**Task 2.0 Summary:**
- ✅ **Root Cause Fixed:** Incorrect `singleSelectOption` field usage replaced with direct `name` field access
- ✅ **Scope:** Fixed across handlers (`prd_handlers.py`, `task_handlers.py`), models (`prd.py`, `task.py`), and all tests
- ✅ **Real API Testing:** Successfully tested PRD completion using MCP tools - status change from "In Progress" to "Done" worked perfectly
- ✅ **616 tests passing** - All unit tests updated with correct mock data structure

## Task 3.0: Search Functionality - **[ ] PENDING**
- [ ] 3.1 Implement advanced search functionality across PRDs, Tasks, and Subtasks
- [ ] 3.2 Add filtering capabilities by status, priority, dates, and metadata
- [ ] 3.3 Implement text search across titles and descriptions
- [ ] 3.4 Add sorting and pagination support for search results

### Core Implementation
- `src/github_project_manager_mcp/handlers/prd_handlers.py` - Fixed GraphQL queries and field access logic
- `src/github_project_manager_mcp/handlers/task_handlers.py` - Fixed field access logic
- `src/github_project_manager_mcp/models/prd.py` - Added backward compatible field parsing
- `src/github_project_manager_mcp/models/task.py` - Added backward compatible field parsing
- `src/github_project_manager_mcp/utils/relationship_manager.py` - Complete relationship management system

### Test Coverage
- `tests/unit/handlers/test_prd_complete_graphql_fix.py` - Comprehensive GraphQL fix validation tests
- `tests/unit/handlers/test_prd_handlers.py` - Updated with correct mock data structure
- `tests/unit/handlers/test_task_handlers.py` - Updated with correct mock data structure
- `tests/unit/models/test_prd_model.py` - Updated with correct mock data structure
- `tests/unit/models/test_task_model.py` - Updated with correct mock data structure
- `tests/unit/utils/test_relationship_manager.py` - Comprehensive relationship management tests

### Technical Architecture
- **GraphQL Schema Compliance:** All queries now use correct GitHub Projects v2 field structure
- **Backward Compatibility:** Models handle both correct and legacy API response structures
- **Real API Validation:** PRD completion tested successfully with actual GitHub API calls
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** 616 tests passing with updated mock data

**Status: ✅ Task 2.0 COMPLETE - PRD completion GraphQL issues fully resolved and tested**
