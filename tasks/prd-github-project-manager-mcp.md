# Product Requirements Document: GitHub Project Manager MCP Server

## Introduction/Overview

The GitHub Project Manager MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI agents (like Claude/Cursor) to automate GitHub project management through a structured workflow. This server bridges the gap between the user's established PRD-driven development workflow and GitHub's project management capabilities, allowing AI agents to automatically update project status as work progresses.

The system implements a hierarchical project structure (Project ‚Üí PRDs ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Subtasks) that mirrors the user's current development methodology while integrating with GitHub Projects v2 for visualization and tracking.

## Goals

1. **Automate GitHub Project Updates**: Enable AI agents to automatically update GitHub project status as PRD workflow progresses
2. **Maintain Workflow Consistency**: Preserve the user's established PRD ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Subtasks development methodology
3. **Provide Progress Visibility**: Offer clear progress tracking through GitHub Projects with status columns
4. **Seamless Integration**: Work directly with Cursor/Claude to eliminate manual project management overhead
5. **Self-Contained Operation**: Function as a standalone MCP server that can be launched by Cursor without external dependencies

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to create a new project in GitHub so that I can organize multiple PRDs under a single initiative
2. **As a developer**, I want to add PRDs to my project so that I can track major feature development efforts
3. **As a developer**, I want the AI agent to automatically create tasks from my PRD so that I don't have to manually set up project tracking
4. **As a developer**, I want the AI agent to update task status as we complete subtasks so that my GitHub project stays current without manual intervention
5. **As a developer**, I want to see progress through status columns (Backlog, This Sprint, Up Next, In Progress, Done) so that I can quickly assess project health
6. **As a developer**, I want to query my project status through the AI agent so that I can get updates without leaving my development environment
7. **As a developer**, I want to move PRDs and tasks between status columns so that I can manage my project flow

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Project Level CRUD (100%)**
- ‚úÖ **Create**: `create_project` - Fully functional with repository association

## Design Considerations

### CRUD-First Development Approach
The implementation follows a hierarchical CRUD completion strategy:
1. **Complete Project Level CRUD** (current focus)
2. **Complete PRD Level CRUD**
3. **Complete Task Level CRUD**
4. **Complete Subtask Level CRUD**
5. **Implement Status Management and Workflow Automation**

This approach ensures solid foundations at each level before building dependent functionality.

### Update Project Requirements
The `update_project` functionality must support:
- **Project Name Updates**: Ability to rename projects while preserving relationships
- **Description Updates**: Modify project descriptions and documentation
- **Visibility Changes**: Update project visibility settings (if supported by GitHub API)
- **Metadata Updates**: Update project fields and custom properties
- **Validation**: Ensure updates don't break existing PRD/Task relationships
- **Audit Trail**: Track update history for debugging and rollback capabilities

### GitHub Projects v2 Structure
- Utilize GitHub Projects v2 as the underlying data store
- Map PRDs to high-level project items with custom fields
- Map Tasks to project items linked to PRD items
- Map Subtasks to checklist items within task items

### Status Column Configuration
- **Backlog**: Items planned but not yet prioritized
- **This Sprint**: Items committed for current development cycle
- **Up Next**: Items ready to begin work
- **In Progress**: Items currently being worked on
- **Done**: Completed items

### MCP Server Architecture
- Implement as standalone Python-based MCP server
- Use GitHub GraphQL API for efficient data operations
- Support both stdio and HTTP transport protocols
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- GitHub GraphQL API access
- Python MCP SDK
- GitHub authentication (Personal Access Token or GitHub App)
- OAuth flow support for secure authentication

### Performance Requirements
- Handle projects with up to 100 PRDs
- Support up to 50 tasks per PRD
- Support up to 20 subtasks per task
- Respond to MCP calls within 2 seconds for standard operations

### Security Requirements
- Secure storage of GitHub authentication tokens
- Proper scope management for GitHub API access
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Rate limiting compliance with GitHub API

### Integration Points
- Must work with Cursor AI environment
- Must integrate with existing PRD workflow tools
- Must support the user's task management rules and protocols

## Success Metrics

1. **Automation Efficiency**: 90% reduction in manual GitHub project management tasks
2. **Workflow Compliance**: 100% of PRD workflow steps automatically reflected in GitHub Projects
3. **Update Accuracy**: 99% accuracy in status updates reflecting actual work progress
4. **Response Time**: Sub-2-second response times for standard MCP operations
5. **User Adoption**: Daily use of the MCP server for project management activities

## Open Questions

1. **GitHub Authentication**: Should we use Personal Access Tokens, GitHub Apps, or support both authentication methods?
2. **Project Templates**: Should we support project templates for common project structures?
3. **Notifications**: Should the system support notifications when status changes occur?
4. **Backup/Export**: Should we include functionality to export project data for backup purposes?
5. **Concurrent Access**: How should we handle potential conflicts if the user manually updates GitHub Projects while the AI agent is working?
6. **Custom Fields**: Should we support additional custom fields beyond the basic PRD/Task/Subtask structure?
